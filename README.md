# SQL_ServerPython
Simple SQL-Server python script to pull data.

This is a very basic script to pull data from a SQL-Server Database I have a hard coded value (ID) to pull a specific record and the fetchone only returns the one record.

If your variable was a 'Type' field, fetchall would return all matching records.
